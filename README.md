# NEXUS — Deep Cyber Amethyst

Ibrahim's personal operating system — five specialized apps, one cohesive interface, zero subscriptions, zero frameworks.

Everything runs in the browser. Data lives in `localStorage` first (instant, offline-first), and optionally mirrors to a Supabase cloud database so phone and laptop stay in sync within about a second of each other. No build step, no `npm install`, no bundler. Drop the folder on any static host and it works.

## Color Scheme — Deep Cyber Amethyst

All CSS custom properties are defined in each page's `:root` block and are consistent across every file.

| Token | Value | Used For |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg` | `#0A0813` | Global background |
| `--bg-card` | `#12101F` | Card surfaces |
| `--border` | `rgba(138,43,226,0.18)` | Card outlines, dividers |
| `--border-strong` | `rgba(138,43,226,0.40)` | Active borders, focused inputs |
| `--amethyst` | `#8A2BE2` | Gradient start, primary accent |
| `--magenta` | `#FF1493` | Gradient end, highlights |
| `--indigo` | `#B026FF` | Mid-spectrum accent |
| `--violet-muted` | `#6B4FA0` | Secondary, HIIT badge, rest cells |
| `--gray-rest` | `#4A445E` | Rest timer warning state |
| `--text-1` | `#FFFFFF` | Primary text |
| `--text-2` | `#D4CFE5` | Secondary text |
| `--text-3` | `#8A7FA8` | Muted labels |
| `--text-4` | `#5A4E78` | Disabled / placeholder |
| `--push` | `#FF1493` | Day A color (Push + Planche) |
| `--pull` | `#B026FF` | Day B color (Pull + Front Lever) |
| `--legs` | `#8A2BE2` | Day C color (Handstand + Core) |
| `--core` | `#6B4FA0` | Day D color (Legs + Conditioning) |
| `--font` | system-ui stack | Body text |
| `--mono` | ui-monospace stack | Stats, labels, inputs |

Primary gradient: `linear-gradient(135deg, #8A2BE2 0%, #B026FF 50%, #FF1493 100%)`

Progress fills, rings, sparklines, and CTA buttons all use this gradient. The aurora background uses radial blurs at 20–22% opacity to keep it subtle.

## The Five Apps

### 🎯 Goals — `index.html`
Home screen and command center.

## Architecture

**Zero-dependency core.** Vanilla JavaScript (ES2020+), CSS3, HTML5. Every page opens directly in a browser — no compilation, no bundler, no Node required.

**Local-first storage.** All reads and writes hit `localStorage` immediately. `sync.js` watches a whitelisted set of keys per app and pushes debounced updates to Supabase in the background. On load it pulls remote state and merges. Real-time sync via Supabase `postgres_changes` subscription.

**Shared chrome — `topbar.js`.** A sticky status bar injected on every page showing live counts for all five apps. The NEXUS wordmark uses the indigo→magenta gradient.

**PWA — `manifest.json` + `sw.js`.** Fully installable on iOS and Android. Launches full-screen with no browser chrome. Theme color `#0A0813`.

## Getting Started

### 1. Deploy
Push the folder to GitHub, then import on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) — zero config, it's static files.

### 2. Cloud Sync (optional)
1. Create a free project at [Supabase](https://supabase.com).
2. Run this SQL in the Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
create table app_state (
  key text primary key,
  data jsonb,
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);
alter table app_state enable row level security;
create policy "public access" on app_state for all using (true);
```
3. Paste your Supabase project URL and anon key into `sync.js` and `topbar.js`.

### 3. Install on iPhone
Open your deployed URL in Safari → Share → **Add to Home Screen**. Launches full-screen. Theme color `#0A0813` makes the status bar match.

### 4. Set your training schedule
In `gym.html`, tap **⚙ Schedule** and select your 4 training days in order. Day A (Push+Planche) maps to your first selection, Day B to second, and so on.

## Adding a Sixth App

1. Create a new `.html` file. Copy the `:root` block from any existing page.
2. Include shared scripts:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js@2"></script>
<script src="sync.js" defer></script>
<script src="topbar.js" defer></script>
```
3. Add an entry to the `TILES` array in `topbar.js` and `index.html`.
4. Call `initCloudSync({ appKey: 'yourapp', syncedKeys: [...] })` at page bottom.
5. Use `linear-gradient(135deg, #8A2BE2, #FF1493)` for progress fills and primary actions. Use `rgba(138,43,226,0.X)` for card backgrounds and surface tints.
